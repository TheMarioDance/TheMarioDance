## Hello, World!

👋 Hi, I'm Juan Fernando, a passionate Industrial Engineer and Economist dedicated to excellence in financial analysis and project evaluation 📈.

### About Me

With a solid background in financial concepts such as cash flow analysis, net present value, and internal rate of return, I excel in making informed investment decisions 📊.
I'm not a software engineer, but I'm really interested in coding to help with my work in finance and engineering. I see coding as a valuable tool to add to my skills, as a form to automate my analyses and make my work more efficient 🚀.


On the personal side, I'm a big fan of Formula 1 and enjoy watching football. These sports provide a welcome break from my professional interests 🏎️.
On a personal note, I'm a huge Marvel fan and also very into Star Wars and anime. I'm also really into tech, always excited to explore the latest gadgets and innovations 🤓.

### My Contribution

I'm eager to bring my analytical, communicational, and leadership skills to roles that demand a deep understanding of finance and data analysis 😊.
